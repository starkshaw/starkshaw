### Hi there, Iâ€™m Zhenbang Xiao. My friends call me Stark Shaw. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Cloud Support Engineer working in AWS, based in Dublin, Ireland.

I recently wrote an article about how to build the online version of Secret Santa on AWS on my personal blog, <a href="https://starkshaw.me/2021/01/23/How-Did-We-Build-the-Online-Version-of-Secret-Santa-Using-AWS/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check it out</a>.

I also have some repos about particular things in AWS:

- Want to know how to sign Signature Version request in Lambda? [Click here](https://github.com/starkshaw/aws-sigv4-lambda).
- Want to know how to generate secret hash for your Cognito app client? [Click here](https://github.com/starkshaw/aws-cognito-secret-hash-generator).
