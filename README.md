### Hi there, Iâ€™m Zhenbang Xiao. My friends call me Stark Shaw. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Cloud Support Engineer working in AWS, based in Dublin, Ireland.

Want to know how to create a custom Docker image and run it in AWS Lambda? <a href="https://starkshaw.me/2021/11/13/How-To-Build-Lambda-Function-with-Other-Linux-Distro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check the article here</a>.
